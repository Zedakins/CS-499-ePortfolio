## Overview
This code review walks through the original version of my artifact, highlighting its existing functionality, areas for improvement, and planned enhancements.

## What I Cover
1. **Existing functionality** — A walkthrough of the single-file program demonstrating exception handling.
2. **Code analysis** — Identification of structural limitations, lack of modularity, absence of tests, and no persistence layer.
3. **Enhancement plan** — Refactoring into modular components, adding unit tests and CI, designing a batch processor, and integrating a database.
4. **Validation plan** — Using unit testing, benchmarking, and database queries to confirm the success of enhancements.
